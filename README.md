# Calculator

The Odin Project Final project: Calculator.

I was able to implement a calculator with a sign and decimal functionality. This application works like a
normal calculator and will evaluate one operation at a time, with the functionality of chain operations.

The UI was changed as well with a simple color palette, but without highlighting elements when buttons
are pressed.
